# SequenC
SequenC is a minimalist puzzle game for android devices.
It was designed for easy play, which makes it perfect for playing during your daily commute, while waiting in lines, and at that boring lecture you still need to pay half an ear to. To be honest, it is a time waster game, but I'd say that in a good light. Sometimes, we need a distraction, and as long as you are not driving, SequenC is a solid one.

# Motivation
SequenC came from my desire to follow stablished game design methods and come up with a simple but deep set of mechanics. So when a multimedia class required that we create a mobile application without external libraries or frameworks, I knew it was the time. While working on this game, I was heavily inspired by other time waster games, like Red7, Triple Town, Atomas and Threes. Ok, specially Threes. But that is a great game to be inspired by if nothing else!

# The Process
Different from most other games I made in my life, this one was designed in a completely exploratory fashion. I tried to hold on to no ideas or concepts other than that;
* A. It had to have a simple rule set
* B. It had to be minimalist(due to the aforementioned constraints)
* C. It had to be fun(duh!)
It was a very interesting experience, with each round of paper prototyping and playtesting severely changing the direction of the project. At one point the game was a strange Blockout game with tetriminos, at another it was a colorcoded version of peggle, and so on.
In the end I decided to stick with the current ruleset because it not only was one of the most favored by the testers, but it was also the most favored by myself.(And hey, my opinion counts too!)
Sadly, after days of dealing with android studio to get even a passable version out, I ended up feeling really burnout with the project. Developing for pure android is like going through a purgatory of bugs; you wait in line for way too long just to get a slap in the face and sent back to the end of the line.
In time I hope I can find the heart in me to make another version of this game in Unity, with proper animations and sound effects. It might be tiny, but this fella deserves it.

# Rules
1. You interact with the game by choosing a tile and moving it to an open space.
2. When you do that, the next tile comes into the board at the place the moved tile was originally.
3. If at any point in the game, a tile forms an ascending or descending sequence with at least 3 numbers, the tiles coalesce into the last added tile and that tile becomes the next ascending number of the sequence.
4. At all times, a display above the board shows the next tile to come in.
5. The game ends when the board is full.
